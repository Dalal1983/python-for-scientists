# Python for Scientists

This repository contains my personal notes captured during a python-course for scientists at University of Heidelberg, Germany. The lecture can be found [online](http://wwwstaff.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/kruijssen/pycourse/), was given by [Diederik Kruijssen](http://www.diederikkruijssen.com/) and is based on a [course](http://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/~robitaille/PY4SCI_SS_2015/) created by [Thomas Robitaille](http://www.thomasrobitaille.com) who was astrophysicist at Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg and one of the co-ordinators of the [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org) project.
